Project Summary >>
My project is connected to the Pcom project, which is a gadget attached to the fridge handle to encourage mindful eating.
The way it works is, when someone touched the fridge handle, it sends data over Bluetooth/Wifi, which prompts to take a breather, solve puzzles, or play games.

I'm working on this project solo, and I will be creating these interfaces and games using code. I will be using P5js libraries to incporate motion and sound, in addition to adding interactivity.
