/Project Summary >>
My project is connected to the Pcom project, which is a gadget attached to the fridge handle to encourage mindful eating.
The way it works is that when someone touches the fridge handle, it sends data over Bluetooth/Wifi, which prompts them to take a breather, solve puzzles, or play games.

/Project >> 
I'm working on this project solo, and I will be creating these interfaces and games using code. 
I will be using P5js libraries to incorporate motion and sound in addition to adding interactivity. 

/Project Update >>
The project will be aimed towards mindful eating for late-night snackers. 
For Hello World, my project will be about coding screens on the iPad. The idea is an emojie that's sleeping, and once it detects movement around the iPad.
It will open its eyes and give a look. 

/Techincal >>
I am currently considering using the ml5.js Library.
